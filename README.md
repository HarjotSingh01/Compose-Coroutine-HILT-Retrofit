I've built an Android project that uses a modern tech stack consisting of several popular libraries and architecture patterns. Specifically, I've integrated **Retrofit** to make HTTP requests and parse responses from API, **HILT** for dependency injection.

To handle asynchronous tasks such as making API calls, I've incorporated **Coroutines**. This helped me simplify my code and manage tasks more effectively. Additionally, I've leveraged the power of **Jetpack Compose** to build a beautiful and interactive UI.

To ensure code maintainability and testability, I followed the **MVVM architecture** pattern. By separating the UI logic from the business logic, I've made my code more modular and easier to test.

Overall, this project showcases a modern approach to Android development that utilizes popular libraries and architecture patterns to build robust and scalable apps.
